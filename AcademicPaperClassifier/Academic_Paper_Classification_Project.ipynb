    "# Transformer-Based Classification for Academic Paper Abstracts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "An academic journal receives a large volume of paper submissions from researchers across various disciplines and topics. The editorial team must manually classify each submission based on its abstract to route it to the appropriate reviewers and organize accepted papers into themed issues. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to human error, potentially delaying the peer review process and leading to inconsistencies in categorization. The journal requires a transformer model-based solution to automatically classify academic papers into predefined categories using their abstracts, streamlining the review process and ensuring accurate categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a transformer-based classification model that automatically categorizes academic paper abstracts into predefined fields of study. This solution streamlines the peer review process by routing submissions to the appropriate experts and organizing accepted papers into themed issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Install & Import the Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required libraries using pip commands to access transformer-based models."
